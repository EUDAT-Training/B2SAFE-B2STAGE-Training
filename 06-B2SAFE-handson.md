# EUDAT B2SAFE hands-on
This hands-on will illustrate how B2SAFE rules can be employed to manage data across iRODS zones by policies.
The tutorial makes use of the icammands. If you did not so then please first follow the tutorial on [using iRODS](https://github.com/chStaiger/B2SAFE-B2STAGE-Training/blob/master/01-iRODS-handson-user.md).

## B2SAFE data transfer workflow (Using B2SAFE)
### To follow this tutorial it is advised to first follow the tutorial on using iRODS.

### Outline
The tutorial will guide you through Step2 in the figure below.
As B2SAFE admin you will copy data from a user, which he/she ingested into the iRODS instance, to another location in iRODS. You will register the data and by that buil the so-called repository of records and replicate the collection to another iRODS server using the B2SAFE rules.
